# Gradle Plugin for J2ObjC

The [Gradle plugin for J2ObjC](https://github.com/j2objc-contrib/j2objc-gradle)
is the suggested way of working with J2ObjC for Android Studio, which uses
[Gradle](http://gradle.org/) by default. The plugin is actively developed by a
number of ex-Google engineers and others. For more details see [its GitHub
repository](https://github.com/j2objc-contrib/j2objc-gradle).
