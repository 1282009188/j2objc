J2ObjC is currently in beta quality, and we love helping developers complete their Java translation projects.

There are a few different data sources we monitor to answer J2ObjC questions.  You can find and post questions on [StackOverflow with the tag j2objc](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/j2objc).  There is a [j2objc-discuss Google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/j2objc-discuss) with lots of helpful people and great information.    You can always dive into the source [on Github](https://github.com/google/j2objc).
