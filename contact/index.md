## Contact, Questions, and Community Resources ##
J2ObjC is currently in beta quality, and we appreciate reports on any bugs or issues.

There are a few different data sources we monitor for J2ObjC feedback.  The recommended option is to post a new topic to the [j2objc-discuss Google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/j2objc-discuss), which is a great resource for discussions, project feedback, and insights into project direction and issues.  We also keep an eye on [StackOverflow posts tagged j2objc](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/j2objc).  Finally, you can find the source [on Github](https://github.com/google/j2objc) and reach us via the usual means of [issues](https://github.com/google/j2objc/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/google/j2objc/pulls).
